                <h2>About Pong</h2>
                <div class="about">
                    <p>
                        Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple "tennis like" game
                        features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one
                        to gain10 point, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. The game can be
                        played with two human players, or one player against a computer controlled paddle. The game
                        was originally developed by Allan Alcorn and released in 1972 by Atari corporations. Soon,
                        Pong became a huge success, and became the first commercially successful game, on 1975,
                        Atari release a home edition of Pong (the first version was played on Arcade machines) which
                        sold 150,000 units. Today, the Pong Game is considered to be the game which started the
                        video games industry, as it proved that the video games market can produce significant
                        revenues.

                    <p>
                        Nolan Bushnell founded Atari at 1972 in order to create games and ideas and license them to
                        other companies for mass production. Pong was actually a training exercise for one of
                        Atari's employees - Allan Alcorn, once it was finished, Nolan made few adjustments in order
                        to make the game more interesting (like changing the ball's return angle) and added simple
                        sound effects. The first Pong Arcade machine was installed on a local bar, and it was so
                        successful that Atari decided to produce and sell the game by themselves, rather then
                        licensing it to other companies. In 1973 the company finally got a line of credit from Wells
                        Fargo and started an assembly line, by the end of the year, Pong arcade machines were
                        shipped to location all over the U.S. as well as to other countries.<br>
                        Similar to other famous games such as Pacman and Tetris, Pong became one of the symbols of
                        computer gaming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Atari sold more then 35000 Pong machines, this figure is only about one third of the total
                        number of Pong machines that were sold globally, since many Pong clones appeared shortly
                        after the debut of the original Atari Pong game. The way Atari chose to compete with the
                        Pong Game clones was to produce more innovative games such as "Double Pong" which was a pong
                        game with four players, two in every side and a bigger screen.
